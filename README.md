## running

There's a Linux executable in `bin`, and there will be Mac and Windows executables as soon as I get that working. In the meantime, you can install Godot and run the project from the editor.
Dependencies:
- Godot
- scons
- Optional: [run](https://github.com/akriegman/run)
- Windows: mingw-g++

I haven't tried running on Mac, there may be more dependencies. The code for Windows is built, so you only need Godot if you just want to run it.

## controls

`w a s d shift space` to move the camera, and use the mouse to look around.
